## A brief description of how you divided the work between you. 
For the majority of the code, we used the Live Share feature of Visual Studio Code and a phone call to code together and plan our design. For the times that we worked asyncronously, Ben used we used a shared git repository to work together remotely. 
##Design overview: 
A few simple paragraphs describing the overall structure of your code and any important structures. 

##Complete specification: 
Describe how you handled any ambiguities in the specification. For example, how do you implement the ANY policy? 

##Known bugs or problems: 
A list of any features that you did not implement or that you know are not working correctly 

##Testing: 
This requirement an aspect that I am very interested in. I will assign points for answering these questions. Describe how you tested the functionality of your web server. Describe how can you use the various versions of your extended client to see if the server is handing requests concurrently and implementing the FIFO, HPSC, or HPDC policies. 
Specifically, what are the exact parameters one should pass to the client and the server to demonstrate that the server is handling requests concurrently? To demonstrate that the server is correctly running the FIFO policy? the HPSC policy? the HPDC policy? In each case, if your client and server are behaving correctly, what output and statistics should you see?
